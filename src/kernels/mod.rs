//! Per-opcode math kernels (single source of truth for formulas).
//!
//! Historical context: before this module, each opcode's numerical
//! formula was duplicated across several CPU AD types (`Dual`,
//! `DualVec`, `Reverse`, `BReverse`, `Laurent`) and the bytecode-tape
//! opcode dispatcher (`opcode.rs`). The GPU side — WGSL shaders and the
//! CUDA NVRTC kernel — carry yet another copy in their respective
//! source-level languages. A change to one copy could drift silently
//! from the others; Phase 7 of Cycle 6 found multiple such drifts
//! (atan large-|a|, div small-|b|, hypot Inf handling).
//!
//! Going forward, any numerical formula shared between the CPU AD
//! types **and** the opcode dispatcher should live here as a single
//! generic function over `num_traits::Float`. Each AD type then
//! delegates to the helper, so CPU drift becomes impossible. GPU
//! drift is caught by `tests/gpu_cpu_parity.rs`.
//!
//! Scope note: This module is intentionally minimal at the start.
//! Only the formulas most prone to recent drift (hypot partials,
//! atan large-|a|) are extracted; the rest remain inline in the AD
//! types and opcode dispatcher. Every extraction here must come with
//! a call-site refactor so we don't add abstraction for its own sake.
