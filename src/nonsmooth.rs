//! Nonsmooth extensions: branch tracking, kink detection, and Clarke subdifferential.
//!
//! Implements Griewank & Walther, Chapter 14. Provides data structures for
//! tracking which branch of nonsmooth operations was taken during forward
//! evaluation, and for computing the Clarke generalized Jacobian via
//! enumeration of limiting Jacobians with forced branch choices.
//!
//! Eight nonsmooth operations are tracked:
//! - **`Abs`, `Min`, `Max`** — kinks with nontrivial subdifferentials (the two
//!   sides of the kink have different derivatives). These contribute distinct
//!   limiting Jacobians in Clarke enumeration.
//! - **`Signum`, `Floor`, `Ceil`, `Round`, `Trunc`** — step-function
//!   discontinuities where both sides have zero derivative. These are tracked
//!   for proximity detection (via [`NonsmoothInfo::active_kinks`]) but are
//!   filtered out of Clarke enumeration since their forced branches produce
//!   identical partials.
